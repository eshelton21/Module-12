Module 13
Elements of Regression Analysis

Objectives: 
  Understand that the object of regression is to partition variancein the response variable among different sources, that can be explained by the regression model itself, v. left-over error or residaul variance.
  Calculate standard errors for regression coefficients and predicted values of response variable based on the regression model, as seen in the lm() function.
  Discuss ways to transform non-normally distributed data to make it more appropriate to analyze using linear regression.

Packages: {curl}, {car}

Terms and Definitions
  SSY = SSR + SSE: (sum of squares of y/total variation in y) equals )regression sum of squares/variation explained by the model) plus (error sum of squares/variation left over as error)
  ANOVA table for the model: summary on how variance is partitioned among different sources; requires various sums of squares and df associated with each variation. Sum of squares, df, Mean Squares (SS/df) for regression, error, and total; one F ratio.
  df for SSR = number of predictor variables (in this case 1); df for SSE = n-2; df for SSY = n-1.
  F ratio: ratio of the variance explained by the regression model to the remaining, unexplained variance; MSR/MSE.
  F distribution: a continuous probability distribution, defined for x≥0 and governed by the parameters df1 and df2. The overall significance of the regression models is found by evaluating the F ratio stat against the F distribution. The critical value above which the variances being comparable is rejected is given by qf(p,df1,df2), where p=1-alpha and df1 and df2 are the dfs in the sources being compared.
  Coefficient of determination: R-squared value, fraction of the total variaiton explained by the model. The square root of this is the correlation coefficient.
  Standard error of the regression slope (beta1) = sqrt(MSE/SSX)
  Standard error of the intercept (beta0) = sqrt((MSE*sum(m$model$weight^2))/(1000*SSX))
  Standard error of each predicted value of y (yhat) = sqrt(MSE*(1/n+(m$model$weight - mean(m$model$weight))^2/SSX))

Functions and Arguments
  >lm(data = [data table], [y variable] ~ [x variable])
  
  +[lm() variable]$model$[column name]: data structure that duplicates the raw data.
  +[lm() variable]$fitted.values: predicted [variable being examined]
  >1-pf(q = fratio, df1 = 1, df2 = 998): directly estimates a p value associated with the calculated f ratio value.
  >aov(): returns a model object that we can use summary() on to look at the results; summary.aov() can also be used.
